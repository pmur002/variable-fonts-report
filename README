+ Addition of 'fontVariations' to glyphFont() in R 4.6.0

  + Only supported by Quartz and Cairo (but not cairo_pdf()).

+ Addition of "luahbtex" engine to {xdvir}
  
  + Requires R 4.6.0 and recent lualatex

    => the {xdvir} variable font examples have to run in docker container
       or old graphics desktop (Ubuntu 24.04)

+ Do Brath map example ?
